# Eye-Detector
The project leverages advanced algorithms from OpenCV,Scipy, Face Recognition, and dlib to accurately detect and interpret eye movements in real-time, enabling precise tracking of gaze directions and gestures.
A user-friendly interface empowers individuals with severe physical disabilities to control household devices solely through their eye movements, fostering independence and autonomy.
By integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning, the project enhances the reliability and efficiency of eye blink detection, significantly improving the quality of life for users.
